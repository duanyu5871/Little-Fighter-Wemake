/**
 * Mutation spec for `native/lfw/buff/buff_healing.cpp` and
 * `native/lfw/buff/buff_mp_healing.cpp`.
 *
 * Disproven / unobservable mutations (proven by reading the TS original, the port
 * and the case file, not by a surviving run):
 *
 * 1. `Buff_MpHealing.on_tick`'s missing `hp >= hp_r` short circuit is *intentional*:
 *    the TS original has it commented out. A mutation that re-adds it would change
 *    behaviour, but it is not a mutation of existing port text, so it is out of
 *    scope here. The case still covers the cap through `min(mp_max, ...)`.
 * 2. `IBuffEntity::hp` / `hp_r` / `set_hp` / `mp` / `mp_max` / `set_mp` default
 *    implementations in `buff.h` are pure accessors that every fake overrides;
 *    mutating a default body changes nothing observable for this subject.
 * 3. `if (victim == nullptr) continue;` cannot be dropped (null dereference) and can
 *    never be taken (the harness resolves every victim id); only the inverted form
 *    is observable and is covered below.
 * 4. `Buff_Healing` / `Buff_MpHealing` share the `mount`/`unmount`/`on_tick` shapes,
 *    so several notes are deliberately duplicated per file: each `file` is mutated
 *    independently, and killing the variant in one file says nothing about the other.
