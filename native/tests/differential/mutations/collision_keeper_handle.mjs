/**
 * Mutation spec for the `handle()` half of `native/lfw/collision/keeper.cpp`.
 *
 * Disproven / unobservable mutations (proven by reading the TS original, the port
 * and the case file, not by a surviving run):
 *
 * 1. Everything about `ball_hit` is unobservable. The TS original accumulates it
 *    (`ball_hit = ball_hit || fn === handle_ball_is_hit_a || ...`) and then never
 *    reads it again -- it is dead in the original too. The port keeps the
 *    accumulation for fidelity and the variable is explicitly discarded.
 * 2. `g_env.ball_frozen(collision.victim, collision.attacker, itr)`'s *third*
 *    argument is not observable: the seam receives it but the harness cannot make
 *    the real TS `handle_ball_frozen` react to it (that would need a full
 *    eleven-property entity fake; the frozen-ball behaviour is gated by the
 *    `collision_ball_frozen` subject instead). The argument *order* of the first
 *    two parameters IS observable -- the harness seam returns
 *    `first.id != u"V"`, so swapping them flips the result and skips the action
 *    dispatch that the TS side still performs.
 * 3. `if (collision.core->find_object_data(collision.vdata_id, data))` is always
 *    true in this harness, so dropping the `if` (or inverting it) changes nothing
 *    observable.
 * 4. `handlers == nullptr` versus `handlers->empty()`: the case always seeds a
 *    vector, so the null arm is unreachable; the port keeps the null guard because
 *    `Collision::handlers` is a `shared_ptr` that is only allocated by
 *    `load_handlers`.
 * 5. `out.push_back(std::nullopt)` for a falsy `pretest` is unobservable: the
 *    cached element is only read on the `truthy(pretest)` path, so a falsy
 *    `pretest` always re-runs the tester at dispatch time.
 * 6. `field_or(collision.itr, u"actions")` reads `collision.itr` twice (once for
 *    the reference `itr`, once for `actions`); swapping those two reads is
 *    behaviour preserving.
 * 7. `enum_name`'s fallback string is only reachable when the dev branch formats an
 *    unknown kind; the case covers that with `kind n 99`. The `<=` / `<` edges of
 *    the entry lookup are covered by the "first/last entry wins" pair below.
