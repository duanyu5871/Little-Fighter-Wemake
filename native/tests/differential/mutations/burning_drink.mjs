// Mutation spec for the `burning_drink` differential slice.
//
// Subject: native/lfw/state/character_state_drink.{h,cpp}
//        + native/lfw/state/state_burning.{h,cpp}
//        + the new character-proxy constructor / dispatch in
//          native/lfw/state/state_base_proxy.{h,cpp}
//
// Notes recorded up front (unobservable-by-design items, not silently skipped):
//  * `holding.hp = holding.hp_r = 1` is a right-to-left assignment chain; the
//    two seams stay SILENT, so swapping the two calls (or the order of the
//    two `set_hp` calls) is unobservable and intentionally absent.
//  * `holding.lfw.mt.mark = "drink_drop"` used to be treated as an unobservable debug
//    probe (the C++ MT port had no `mark` / `mt_cases` back then). 9k changed that:
//    the port now writes it through the new `holding_mt_mark` seam and the `run mtmark`
//    op prints it, so this write has real mutations below.
//  * `drink.hp_h_value` and friends are `number` in the original types; a
//    string would make TS `+` concatenate while the port adds numerically.
//    The cases only feed numbers, so the ported arithmetic is exact for every
//    covered input.
//  * The three `*_empty` reads are destructured once in TS and read once in
//    the port; re-reading them per branch is pure and therefore unobservable.
//  * Mutating `if (drink == nullptr) return;` away would dereference a null
//    pointer (UB, not a divergence), so the guard itself is not mutated.
//  * `State_Burning` passes `void 0` for weapon/ball/proxy; those three stay
//    default-constructed from `state`, which is exactly what the port does.
//  * The `next_frame` helper builds `{id:"auto"}`; a single-key object has no
//    key-order freedom.
//  * The `mt.range(-6, 6)` result is injected (`holding_mt_range`); the real
//    MT stream is covered by the `mersenne_twister` subject, so this slice
//    only locks the argument order / bounds / division through the log.
