/**
 * Mutation spec for `native/lfw/collision/keeper.cpp`.
 *
 * This unit currently covers the *registry* half of `CollisionKeeper.ts`
 * (`pack_a`/`pack_b`/`is_u8,u12,u16`/`add`/`register`/`load_handlers` plus the
 * `HANDLER_CONFIGS` table and the `collisions_keeper` singleton). `handle()` is
 * deliberately left for the follow-up unit: it needs the entity-side
 * `collided_list` / `collision_list` surfaces, the `collision_action_handlers`
 * dispatch and a `IFrozenEntity` adapter for `handle_ball_frozen`, none of which
 * exist yet. Shipping `handle()` now would make most of this subject's diff test
 * the seams instead of the unit.
 *
 * Disproven / unobservable mutations (proven by reading the TS original, the port
 * and the case file, not by a surviving run):
 *
 * 1. `pack_a`'s and `pack_b`'s shift constants are unobservable: both helpers are
 *    used by `add` (insertion) and by `load_handlers` (lookup), so any *consistent*
 *    change of the shift moves both sides together and the mapping stays injective
 *    for every real kind (a shift of 11 would only collide once `itr_kind` reached
 *    2**11, which the `is_u12` guard forbids). The observable forms are the ones
 *    that make `pack_a` / `pack_b` ignore one of their arguments, covered below.
 *    Likewise `|` -> `+` is unobservable because the shifted operands never overlap.
 * 2. The *integer* half of the guards (`*d == floor(*d)`) is unobservable for the
 *    `Value` overload: a fractional kind such as `1.5` truncates to `1` inside
 *    `static_cast<int32_t>` and the packed key still misses the table, so both the
 *    guarded and the unguarded run return `false`. A non numeric kind *is*
 *    observable (the `std::get_if<double>` arm) and is covered below.
 * 3. The *range* halves (`< 256` / `< 4096` / `< 65536`) cannot be reached from
 *    in-contract inputs: every registered `a_type`/`v_type` is one of 4/8/16/32 and
 *    every `itr`/`bdy` kind is far below its ceiling, so raising or lowering the
 *    ceiling without crossing a *real* value changes nothing. The observable form
 *    is a ceiling that rejects a real value (`< 4`) and is covered below.
 * 4. `found->empty()` is never true: `NestedMap::ref` only creates an inner entry
 *    while pushing, so a key that exists always holds at least one entry.
 * 5. `g_env.attacker_state()` is never read: no entry in `HANDLER_CONFIGS` passes an
 *    `a_state`, so `has_a_state` is `false` everywhere and the a_state filter never
 *    runs. Its counterpart (`victim_state`) *is* exercised by the weapon entries.
 *    The observable consequence of that fact (dropping the `has_*_state` flag from
 *    the filter) is covered below.
 * 6. `if (collision.handlers) ... else ...` inverted is unobservable: both arms end
 *    up with an empty handler vector.
 * 7. `handle_body_goto` is registered under the TS alias `handle_criminal_hit`, but
 *    `Function.prototype.name` reports the *declared* name, so the port stores
 *    `"handle_body_goto"`. The case asserts that string.
