/**
 * Mutation spec for `native/lfw/buff/buff_electroshock.{h,cpp}`.
 *
 * Disproven / unobservable mutations (proven by reading the TS original, the port
 * and the case file, not by a surviving run):
 *
 * 1. `static KIND = "Electroshock"` is unobservable *in this unit*: unlike
 *    `Buff_GroupAttack` / `Buff_Electrify` (which use their KIND as a mark key),
 *    `Buff_Electroshock` never reads it. It exists for the `grant_buff` callers
 *    (e.g. `handlers2` passes `u"Electroshock"`) and belongs to those subjects.
 * 2. `effect_frame_id()` is **not** overridden, so the base `"0"` is used. Adding an
 *    override would be new behaviour, not a mutation of existing port text; the
 *    inherited value is asserted by the case (`enter_frame_by_id:s"0"`).
 * 3. Dropping `round_float(...)` from `set_duration(round_float(duration() / 2))` is
 *    unobservable: `Times::set_max` (i.e. `set_duration`) applies `lfw::floor`, so
 *    `duration()` is always an integer and `duration() / 2` is exact to one decimal
 *    place -- `round_float`'s 1000x multiplier can never change it.
 * 4. `if (victim == nullptr) return;` / `if (victim == nullptr) continue;` cannot be
 *    dropped (null dereference) and can never be taken (the harness resolves every
 *    victim id); only the inverted forms are observable and are covered below.
 * 5. `on_tick`'s two guards and `mount`'s two guards are deliberately separate
 *    statements (the TS original writes them as separate `if`s). Removing one of a
 *    pair is only observable because the case pins *every* victim in the list to a
 *    state the surviving guard accepts -- with a second victim in a neutral state the
 *    duration would be halved anyway and the mutation would hide behind it.
