/**
 * Mutation spec for `native/lfw/collision/handlers4.cpp`.
 *
 * Disproven / unobservable mutations (proven by reading both sources, not by a
 * surviving run):
 *
 * 1. `if (a == nullptr || v == nullptr) return;` -> `&&`. The differential harness
 *    always registers both ids (`A` and `V`) in `find_entity`, so neither ever
 *    resolves to null and the two variants are indistinguishable. The guard itself
 *    is a port artefact: the TS source destructures `collision.attacker/victim`
 *    directly and has no equivalent check.
 * 2. `if (a == nullptr) return;` (weapon path) -> dropped line. `a` is always
 *    resolvable, so removing the guard cannot change the observed trace.
 *    For the same reason the `if (a == nullptr || v == nullptr) return;` and
 *    `if (a == nullptr) return;` guards cannot be inverted into `!=`.
 * 2b. `if (state_is(a->state(), StateEnum::Weapon_OnHand)) return;` -> dropped
 *    line. The only state it short-circuits is `Weapon_OnHand`, and the very next
 *    statement (`if (!state_is(state, Weapon_Throwing)) return;`) returns for that
 *    same state, so the observable trace is identical. The TS source has the same
 *    redundancy (a guard followed by a `switch` with a single `Weapon_Throwing`
 *    case), so this is faithful, not a port defect. Mutations that make the guard
 *    *fire on other states* (inverting it, or comparing `Weapon_Throwing`) are
 *    observable and are included below.
 * 3. `double vx = 0;` / `double vy = 0;` initialisers -> any other number, and
 *    reordering the three declarations. `a->velocity(vx, vy, vz)` overwrites all
 *    three before they are read, so the initial values are dead.
 * 4. The TS `switch (aframe.behavior)` lists `DennisChase`, `Boomerang`,
 *    `AngelBlessing`, `AngelBlessingStart`, `DevilJudgementStart`,
 *    `ChasingSameEnemy`, `BatStart`, `FirzenDisasterStart`, `JohnBiscuitLeaving`,
 *    `FirzenVolcanoStart`, `Bat`, `JulianBallStart` and `JulianBall` as cases whose
 *    bodies are a bare `break`. Such a switch is semantically identical to omitting
 *    those labels entirely, so the port drops them and no mutation can be anchored
 *    on them.
 * 5. `if (truthy(bdefend) && ge(bdefend, Defines.DEFAULT_FORCE_BREAK_DEFEND_VALUE))`
 *    -> dropping the `truthy(bdefend) &&` prefix. No JavaScript value is falsy
 *    while also satisfying `value >= 200`: `>=` forces `ToNumber`, every numeric
 *    result `>= 200` is non-zero and therefore truthy, and each remaining falsy
 *    value (`0`, `-0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `NaN`) either coerces
 *    below 200 or to `NaN` -- and the port's `ge` returns false when `ToNumber`
 *    yields `NaN` (it propagates `std::nullopt` from `less_than`). The prefix is
 *    therefore dead code in the TS original and in the port alike.
