/**
 * Mutation spec for `native/lfw/collision/weapon_is_hit.cpp`.
 *
 * Disproven / unobservable mutations (proven by reading the TS original, the port
 * and the case file, not by a surviving run):
 *
 * 1. `if (a == nullptr || v == nullptr) return;` -> `&&`, or inverted to `!=`.
 *    The harness always registers both ids (`A` and `V`), so neither lookup can
 *    return null and the variants are indistinguishable. The guard is a port
 *    artefact: the TS original destructures `collision.attacker/victim`.
 * 2. `truthy(bdefend) && ge(bdefend, Defines.DEFAULT_FORCE_BREAK_DEFEND_VALUE)` ->
 *    dropping the `truthy(bdefend) &&` prefix. No JS value is falsy while also
 *    satisfying `value >= 200`: `>=` forces `ToNumber`, every numeric result
 *    `>= 200` is non-zero, and every other falsy value coerces below 200 or to
 *    `NaN` (and the port's `ge` returns false when `ToNumber` yields `NaN`). The
 *    prefix is dead in the TS original and in the port alike.
 * 3. `truthy(fall) && ge(fall, Defines.DEFAULT_FALL_VALUE_CRITICAL)` -> dropping
 *    the `truthy(fall) &&` prefix, for exactly the same reason as (2) with a
 *    threshold of 140. Note this is *not* the same as the `&&` -> `||` mutation,
 *    which is observable and is included below.
 * 4. `if (arr->size() == 0) return Value();` inside `index_0` -> changing the
 *    comparison bound. Any such change makes the empty-`throwings` cases read
 *    `Array::at(0)` out of bounds, i.e. undefined behaviour rather than a defined
 *    divergence, so it is excluded on purpose. The neighbouring `arr->at(0)` index
 *    is mutable and is covered.
 * 5. `const Array* arr = as_array(holder);` -> forcing `nullptr`. That would skip
 *    the array branch entirely; the only remaining sources would be the object
 *    branch and the final `Value()`, and the case file's array inputs would all
 *    fall through to `undefined`. It is therefore observable, and it is included
 *    below as the `as_array` -> `as_object` variant instead.
