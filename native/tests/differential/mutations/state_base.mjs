/**
 * Mutation spec for `native/lfw/state/state_base.{h,cpp}`.
 *
 * Disproven / unobservable mutations (proven by reading the TS original, the port
 * and the case file, not by a surviving run):
 *
 * 1. `update(e)` is an **empty** method in `State_Base.ts`; there is nothing in it to
 *    change, so the case only asserts that calling it produces no log and no state
 *    change.
 * 2. The optional hooks (`pre_update` / `enter` / `on_dead` / `on_landing` /
 *    `get_gravity` / `get_sudden_death_frame` / `get_caught_end_frame` /
 *    `get_auto_frame` / `find_frame_by_id` / `on_leave_ground`) are declaration-only in
 *    this unit: `State_Base.ts` declares them with `?` and nothing in the class calls
 *    them. They are modelled as empty `std::function` members, which reproduces the
 *    `?.` truthiness check the real callers use (`this._state?.get_gravity?.(this)` is
 *    exactly `if (s->get_gravity) ...`). Their bodies belong to the state subclasses
 *    and to the `States` unit.
 * 3. `leave`'s `next_frame` parameter is unused by `State_Base.ts` itself.
 * 4. `grant_buff` passing `nullptr` as the attacker is unobservable here: the only
 *    effect of a non-null attacker is `Buff::set_attacker_entity`, which this unit's
 *    harness neither logs nor reads back.
 * 5. `e.set_velocity(vx, null, vz)` writes `null` for `y`; the harness reproduces the
 *    real `Entity.set_velocity` rule (skip `null` / `undefined`), so `y` is only
 *    observable through the log text.
